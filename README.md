## Future-Developements

* Clean up the user interface, for Example; 
 --after creating User account, automatically prompts or gives you an option to immediately start adding information to your pet profile. Or 
* Have a upgrade the secruity behind this.
* Potientally have a more of seperate more private messanger, so it doesnt just post to someones profile.
* In addition, to the seperate messanger, include notifications that cant send you straight to your mobile.
* Include a better fitler to what you are looking for/ want to see on your list of options.
* Make it Mobile with a very clean-easier to use interface.
* With the expansion of users, we would like it do have a better filteration system, so it can list all of the requirments you are looking for your dog. Ex: Looking for Male, PureBred Husky, etc.

IN the Farther future; Luke would like to have this branch off and use it for like a puppy/adoption "craiglist type" of application.
